# MiniWetter

Open Source, minimalistic weather app to quickly search for current weather and weather forecast for coming 5 days.
Simply upload the code to your servers and get an API key from openweathermap.org to use for your own project.

Weather data from openweathermap.org

*I've unintentionally left my API key in the index.html, for transparency reasons I did not delete the version history, but deactivated the API key itself.
